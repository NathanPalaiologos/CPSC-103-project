The data is from Stats Canada URL: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1810000401 . As requested, I have uploaded the file with this submission.

We will filter for shelter and food independently. To calculate the monthly CPI, we will sum the 8 major components of CPI to calculate the overall CPI.
